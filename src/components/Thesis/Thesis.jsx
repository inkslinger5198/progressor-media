              The ultimate goal when raising capital is to get Term Sheets, not
              to have meetings with investors. While meetings are an important
              first step, it is key to approach raising capital with the end
              goal in mind. <br/><br/>Founders and executives should focus on improving
              their product, managing operations, and growing their team. They
              shouldn't spend all their time on fundraising.<br/><br/> So, what's the
              quickest path to success? The key lies in finding the right
              Investor-Message Fit.
